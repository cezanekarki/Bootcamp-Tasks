Project: Contact Book Application 
Objective: Create a Python program that allows users to manage their contacts. Users should be able to add, view, search for, and delete contacts. 

Project Steps: 
Initialize the Contact Book: 
Create an empty list to represent the contact book. Each contact will be a dictionary with attributes like name, phone number, and email. 
Create Functions: 
Define functions for the following actions: 
Add a contact. 
View all contacts. 
Search for a contact by name. 
Delete a contact by name. 
Main Menu: 
Implement a loop that displays a menu of options for the user. 
Options may include adding a contact, viewing contacts, searching for a contact, deleting a contact, or quitting the program. 
User Input: 
Depending on the user's choice from the menu, prompt them for the necessary input (e.g., name, phone number). 
Perform Actions: 
Based on the user's choice, call the corresponding function to perform the action. 
Display the Updated Contact List: 
After each action, display the updated contact list to the user. 

Exit: 
Allow the user to exit the program when they are done managing their contacts. 

Hints: 
Use a list to store the contact dictionaries. 
Each contact can be represented as a dictionary with keys like "name," "phone," and "email." 
Create functions for adding, viewing, searching, and deleting contacts. 
Implement input validation to handle different user inputs. 
Utilize a lambda function for searching contacts based on name. 
Use *args and **kwargs in functions to handle variable numbers of arguments for contact attributes.
